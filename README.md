# Inside-Joke-Bot

THIS BOT IS CURRENTLY SHUTTING DOWN TEMPORARILY STARTING ON 8/2/2020. THE BOT REQUIRES SOME LONG NEEDED WORK AND THE SERVER COSTS HAVE GROWN PAST AFFORDABILITY CURRENTLY. 
I WILL HAVE THIS BOT BACK UP WITH A SUPPORT SERVER, PATREON, AND WEBSITE ASAP. THANK YOU.

The inside joke bot was designed for content creators, groups of friends, and communities with each and their own specific sense of humor. The bot allows you to submit certain phrases and responses that would make sense accordingly and have a very funny result. It is unique in the fact that the bots humor can be personalized by your submissions, and is not just any other meme bot.

This bot is open source so us together can bring the best experience to your servers. There's nothing fun about a broken bot!
