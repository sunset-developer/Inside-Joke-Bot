<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Comedibot is a customizable meme bot for content creators, communities, and groups of friends. 

Comedibot, unlike most meme bots, has the ability to be totally personalized to your sense of humor.

Comedibot responds to phrases or words detected in chat with a joke, meme, and even audio in ways that can be unexpected and have a very humorous result. What the bot responds too and with is up to you.

You can also tell Comedibot some stupid things your friend has said, always to remember and to bring up later when your friend denies saying something so dumb.

Comedibot is capable of being used in large servers due to administrator commands, role based permissions, and that individual users can rest assured that their jokes can't be tampered with.

So, would you rather a lame, probably unfunny, and personality free meme bot? Or would you rather have the next best thing to bring your friends or your community together with laughter.

Personalized, Customized, Comedibot.
