# Inside-Joke-Bot
Hey! The inside joke bot was designed for content creators, groups of friends, and small communities with each and their specific sense of humor. This bot was designed to bring a unique experience for your discord server and something funny to show your friends. 

This bot is open source so us together can bring the best experience we can to your servers. There's nothing fun about a broken bot!
